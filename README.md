# ðŸ“ƒ Description
This program is a GUI based post-processor that can take a g-code file exported from Cura and edit it to work on a very specific setup of a wire DED metal 3D printer and CNC machine. When ran, it adds neccesary commands, like turning the laser on/off or retracting the weld wire, and comments in the g-code that help the user with the print, such as length of time for print, min/max dimensions, and the total amount of times the laser has to turn on and off. The program allows the user to add customizable wait times at different spots during the print, like during layer changes or when the printer has to move to a new section of the print.

# Usage
By running the driver file, the post processor will launch.

### Macro Menu
In this section, you can customize the macros that will be inserted into different spots of the code. These macros are understood by the CNC machine and do different things and need to be called at specific times. 
The user can customize the following macros:
- Fast Move: the time between moving to a different spot in the same layer
- Layer move: the time between layers
- Printing: tells the printer to begin printing
- Retract: tells the printer to stop printing and retract wire
- Warming: tells the printer to begin warming the plate
- Outer wall, inner wall, and fill: tells the printer to begin printing but with slightly different settings than standard printing

### Toolbox Menu
Only has the ability to print out the currently selected macros. There were plans for potentially more miscellaneous little scripts that could help, hence the name toolbox.
